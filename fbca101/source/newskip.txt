Newskip is a tool that removes "skip" surfaces from a Quake bsp file so that
the game won't draw them. It works on both world brushes and entities, and
supports liquids too. Based on the original concept by Tyrann.

How To Use It
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Using the textures in newskip.wad, mark surfaces in your map that you don't
want drawn in-game.  Skip can be used on any solid brush, *waterskip, *slimeskip,
and *lavaskip are necessary when a brush contains a liquid, becuase all faces on
a brush need to have the same contents type for Qbsp.  Be sure to run Qbsp with
the option -transwater if you do use skip on liquid brushes, otherwise you
won't be able to see anything on the other side of the skipped face.

2) Place newskip.exe somewhere convenient, like where you keep Qbsp. Call it
from the command prompt or in a batch file, like so: "newskip <mapname>"

How It Works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Newskip does not actually delete anything from the bsp file, so the processed
file will still be the same size as the original.  What newskip does is re-
arrange the internal arrays of surfaces in the file, and lowers the total
surface counts so that the surfaces at the end of the list are ignored by the
engine when rendering.

For the world itself, Newskip edits each leaf's "nummarksurfaces" count and
reorders the marksurfaces array.  For brush entities, Newskip edits each
model's "numfaces" count and reorders the surfaces array.
