<remarks>


This variable toggles the use of lights at full brightness on the map. When this 
variable is set to &quot;1&quot; the renderer system will render all textures on the map 
at full brightness. This will allow map authors to remove all of the lighting 
effects from the map. 
This variable was removed in QWCL and has been re-introduced in this client, 
however it can only be used when the server is running with cheats enabled (for 
example &quot;qwsv -cheats&quot;), because it could be used as a cheat by making it easier
to see players in dark corners when no fullbright skins are used.
