<name>watervis</name>
<description>
This server-side cvar is mirrored to serverinfo as a hint to clients on whether the server is using the so-called watervised maps.

<remarks>


It's a bad idea to use watervis 1 if the maps the server is using are not watervised. Liquids will appear 'transparent' but you won't be able to see any items/players/etc through it.  And it is a bad idea anyway because Quake maps were not designed for transparent water (or other liquids); enabling it changes gameplay, decreases fps and produces more network traffic and puts non-GL players at a disadvantage because the software renderer doesn't support transparent water (yet).
Not saved to config with cfg_save command.
