This variable toggles mouse input filtering. When set to &quot;1&quot;, the values which
are received from the mouse's input will first be averaged together and then 
that value will be used in the game. 
The reason for this command is that some mice had problems with sending sporadic
coordinates which make the input from the mouse jerky, also when using a serial 
or PS/2 mouse, the Windows operating system will only sample mouse input every 
25ms, that is 40 times a second (for USB mice the sample rate is 125 Hz, that is
every 8 ms). When set to &quot;1&quot; this variable will smooth out the input but it will 
cause latency between the movement of the mouse and the actual response in the 
game. When using a PS/2 mouse it is thus first recommended to try to increase 
the sampling rate either by changing it via your mouse driver or by using the 
ps2rate program which can be downloaded at ps2rate homepage . 
If you are playing the game at frame rates above 40 FPS and if you can't 
increase the sampling rate of your PS/2 rate or if you are playing with a serial 
mouse it is recommended that you enable this toggle.
