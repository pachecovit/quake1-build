<name>m_pitch</name>
<description>

This variable sets the level of precision when the mouse is used to make the 
player look up and down while the +mlook command is in effect. By default this 
variable is set in such a way that moving the mouse forward makes the player 
look up and moving the mouse backward makes the player look down. Some people 
prefer to have this movement inverted just like it is inverted for airplane 
controls. If you wish to use this inverted mouse movement then you should set 
this variable to a negative value (for example &quot;-0.022&quot;). It is a matter of 
preference which movement method is used by players. Also lowering the value 
for this variable will increase the level of precision when the mouse is used 
to make the player look up and down. This variable can be used separately from 
the sensitivity variable to provide greater control over the mouse sensitivity 
for movement along the pitch. It is advisable to keep the value for this 
variable constant at 0.022 or -0.022 and instead use the sensitivity variable 
to change the overall sensitivity of the mouse. Also, some script writers lower 
the value for this variable along with a lowered value for the fov variable in 
order to provide more precision when the fov variable is used to zoom.
