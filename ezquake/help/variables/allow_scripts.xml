Possibility to prove, that you do NOT use scripts. Of course, values 0 and 1 will block 'rotate' command.

<value><enum>
	<value><name>
0</name><description>Same as 1, but also block fast +lookdown/+lookup,
                so even simple rjump will be impossible. Blocks KTPro /kfjump and /krjump aliases.</description></value>
	<value><name>1</name><description>Allow only simple scripts - it will block left/right
                turning, so fjump (for example) will be impossible,
                but normal rjump (+lookdown;+attack;+jump) will be
                possible. Blocks KTPro alias /kfjump too.</description></value>
	<value><name>2</name><description>Allow scripts (default)</description></value>
</enum></value>
<remarks>


Your current 'allow_scripts' setting will be reported to
        'f_scripts' query and anyone will be able to check it. If
        anyone said 'f_scripts' since last mapchange, the client will also
        autoreport any change of allow_scripts (just like reporting
        f_skins). So if you don't use scripts, turn them off to prove
        you don't use them. And remember - scripts _are allowed_,
        so don't call ppl who use them 'cheaters'.

You can't set this variable to 2 when a command line parameter -noscripts is used.
