<description>
This variable sets the distance that the player must move before the screen 
automatically centers itself when &quot;lookspring&quot; is set to &quot;1&quot;. This variable is 
only useful to people who only play with the keyboard, have &quot;lookspring&quot; set to
&quot;1&quot; and do not have &quot;+klook&quot; or &quot;+mlook&quot; enabled at that time. When the player 
moves the distance specified in this variable the screen will pop back to the 
center position.
