<name>m_forward</name>
<description>
This variable controls how fast the player should move forward and back when the 
mouse is moved forward and back. This command has no effect if the +mlook 
command is in effect because when the mouse is moved forward and back the 
player looks up and down instead of moving forward and back. Some players might 
want to set this variable to &quot;0&quot; if they happen not to use +mlook constantly and 
they only want to use the mouse to turn the player. Setting this variable to &quot;0&quot;
will prevent the inadvertent movement of the player forward and back while 
trying to make precise turns with the mouse.
