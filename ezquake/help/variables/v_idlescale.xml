This variable controls the amount that the screen should sway automatically.
When this variable is set to a value above &quot;0&quot; the screen will start swaying in 
all directions, similar as if the player was drunk of had a concussion. If you 
want to have some real fun, set this variable to a value of &quot;100&quot; and run around 
some maps. The larger the value for this variable the more the screen will sway 
from side to side.
