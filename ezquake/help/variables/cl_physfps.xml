<name>cl_physfps</name>
<description>
Sets amount of FPS used to communicate with server. This variable is used when +set cl_independentphysics 1 is set so your current amount of FPS is limited by cl_maxfps while this variable limits amout of FPS sent/received to/from server.
When set to zero current cl_maxfps value is used. When cl_maxfps is set to zero too, client displays as much FPS as server and data rate allows.
