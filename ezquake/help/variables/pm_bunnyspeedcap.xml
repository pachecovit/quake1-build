This is experimental code intended to restore class balance in TF. If you set 
this cvar to something like 1.5 or 2, a solider will not be able to bunnyhop as 
fast as a scout does :) Note that this cvar is optional and disabled by default, 
so it will in NO WAY affect gameplay unless you set it explicitly to anything 
but 0.
