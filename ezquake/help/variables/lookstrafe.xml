<name>lookstrafe</name>
<description>
This variable toggles the automatic strafing when the +klook command is used.
When set to &quot;1&quot; and the player used the +klook command, the keys that are bound 
to the +left and +right commands will now act as if they were bound to +moveleft 
and +moveright. This command was put it in order to allow keyboard player to 
combine the +strafe and +klook commands into one.
This command also has effect on the mouse controls. When set to &quot;1&quot; moving the 
mouse left and right will make the player move left and right instead of making 
him turn left and right.
