<description>
This variable controls the amount of ambient lighting on the map. When this 
variable is increased the map will become brighter and all walls and objects 
will be rendered in a lighter color.
It was removed in QWCL and has been re-introduced in this client, however it 
can only be used when the server is running with cheats enabled (for example 
&quot;qwsv -cheats&quot;), because it could be used as a cheat by making it easier to see
players in dark corners when no fullbright skins are used.
