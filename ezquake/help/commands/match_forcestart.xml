<name>match_forcestart</name><description>
Simulates the start of a match (so that auto
recording etc is triggered). Useful if you join a
 ktpro server after countdown has started, or you are playing a
mode that doesn't have a
 proper countdown (eg race mode).
 Most importantly this is useful for tf servers, since you can
use a msg_trigger to execute
 match_forcestart on "MATCH BEGINS NOW".</description><syntax></syntax><remarks></remarks></command>
