This means when you are spectating or watching
an mvd, keys will automatically be assigned
 to track certain players (so in a 4v4 8 keys are needed, the
first 4 make you track the
 4 players in the first team and the last 4 make you track the
second team).</description><syntax></syntax><remarks></remarks></command>
