<name>flush</name><description>
This command will clear the current game
cache. It is usually used by developers
 to flush the memory of all game information and objects to test
if the mechanism
 which handles the loading of the necessary files into memory
works properly.
 Sometimes the game cache can become filled with unnecessary
information and may
 need to be flushed manually. This is usually not necessary since
the game
 automatically flushes all the data between every
map.</description><syntax></syntax><remarks></remarks></command>
