<name>force_centerview</name><description>
This command centers the player's screen. It
was created because the original
 "centerview" command did not work when "+mlook" was enabled.
This command will
 center the screen in any mode no matter commands are
active.</description><syntax></syntax><remarks></remarks></command>
