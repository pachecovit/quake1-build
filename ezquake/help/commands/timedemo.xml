This command can be used to test how fast your
computer is by looking at the
 frames-per-second rate achieved by playing back a demod at top
speed. This
 command will play back all of the frames for a given demo as
fast as possible
 and then record the amount of time that it took to play back all
of the frames
 from that demo. Then this command will take the total number of
frames in a
 demo, divide that number by the amount of time that it took to
play back those
 demos, and calculate the average frames-per-second rate.
 Example:
 timedemo 123.qwd
 timedemo 123.mvd</description><syntax>(filename)</syntax><remarks></remarks></command>
