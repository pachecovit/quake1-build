INSTRUCTIONS
------------

These locs were made by flintheart for FuhQuake.

Put these locs in qw/locs (or id1/locs).  These locs let you customise the
armor, megahealth and separator names, but first you need to set the names like this:

set loc_name_ra "RA"
set loc_name_ya "YA"
set loc_name_ga "GA"
set loc_name_mh "MEGA"			
set loc_name_separator "-" 		(eg "bridge-high", "bridge/high" or "bridge$.high" etc)

If you don't like "RA" you can change it to "ra", "$2$0$0" (gold numbers),
"200", or whatever else you want. The same goes for ya/ga/mh/separator.

Put the 5 set command in your configs so you dont have to set them each time.

All the locs I have done, are actually made with [NF]Proxy (!), and edited with EditPlus.
There should be 151 locfiles in this zip file.

Credits goes to the very eminent qw-clans Flaming Fist, Lege Artis, Lithium and Slackers for inspiration of the marking-layout :)

Have Fun!
